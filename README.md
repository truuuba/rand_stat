# rand_stat
This is a project dedicated to random number generation. Triangular distribution methods using a time function, as well as the linear congruent method, are discussed here.

This was my first experience working with QCustomPlot, many parameters from this library were not used (for example, to adjust the usability of the interface), so the project still needs to be improved
